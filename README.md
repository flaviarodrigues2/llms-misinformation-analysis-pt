# A Linguistic Comparison Between Human- and AI-generated European Portuguese Content

## Overview

This repository contains the full materials and code related to my master's thesis:  
**"A Linguistic Comparison Between Human- and AI-generated European Portuguese Content"**.

The research investigates the linguistic characteristics of true and false news articles in Portuguese, both human-written and AI-generated using Large Language Models (LLMs) — GPT-4o, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B.

It combines advanced linguistic analysis techniques (LIWC, SAGE) and evaluates the robustness of an existing fake news detection model when applied to machine-generated content.

## Objectives

- Identify linguistic features that differentiate human and AI-generated misinformation.
- Compare outputs across three state-of-the-art LLMs in Portuguese.
- Evaluate the performance of a leading fake news detection model on both content types.
- Highlight the need for language-sensitive detection tools in combating AI-generated misinformation.

## Methodology

- **Dataset**:  
  - Human-written true and false news articles in Portuguese, retrieved directly from the 
[fake-news-pt-eu repository](https://github.com/ro-afonso/fake-news-pt-eu) (Afonso & Rosas, 2024). 
  - AI-generated texts based on narrative prompts using GPT-4o, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B.

- **Linguistic Analysis Tools**:  
  - [LIWC] for psychological and stylistic categories  
  - [SAGE] for sparse additive generative modeling

- **Detection Evaluation**:  
  - Tested a pre-trained misinformation classifier on both human and AI-generated content.
